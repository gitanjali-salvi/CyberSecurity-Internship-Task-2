# CyberSecurity-Internship-Task-2
Task 2 – Operating System Security Fundamentals covering Windows and Linux OS hardening, user privileges, file permissions, firewall configuration, and security best practices.

## Task Objective
The objective of this task was to understand operating system level security concepts and basic OS hardening techniques by exploring security features in both Windows and Linux environments.

---

## Tools Used
- Windows Operating System
- Kali Linux (VirtualBox)
- Windows Defender
- Windows Firewall
- Linux Terminal
- UFW Firewall

---

## Tasks Performed

### Windows OS Security
- Checked user accounts and understood administrator vs standard user privileges
- Observed User Account Control (UAC) for administrative actions
- Verified Windows Defender real-time protection
- Explored Windows Firewall settings for different network profiles
- Reviewed running processes and startup applications
- Checked Windows update and patch status

### Linux OS Security
- Identified current user and root privileges using sudo
- Created files and analyzed permissions using `ls -l`
- Modified file permissions using `chmod`
- Changed file ownership using `chown`
- Installed and enabled UFW firewall
- Checked running processes using terminal commands
- Learned basic Linux OS hardening practices

---

## Key Concepts Learned
- Least privilege principle
- Difference between root/administrator and normal user
- File permissions and ownership in Linux
- Firewall importance in OS security
- Reducing attack surface by disabling unnecessary services
- Importance of OS hardening and regular updates

---

## Outcome
This task helped me gain a strong foundation in operating system security by practically exploring built-in security controls in Windows and Linux and understanding how OS hardening helps protect systems from common security threats.
